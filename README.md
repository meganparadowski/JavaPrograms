# JavaPrograms
A collection of simple java programs 

1. remove.java --> enter 10 integers separated by the enter key and the program will remove duplicate integers and display the results
2. Geometric objects:
        GeometricObject.java --> basic class to create a simple geometric object with a string color, fill color, and date created
        ComparableCircle.java --> extends GeometricObject class and implements comparable interface, can set radius, get raidus, area,                                       and perimeter, can return integers that compare one circle to another (1 for larger radius, -1 for                                         smaller radius, 0 for equal)
        UseComparableCircle.java --> calls methods from ComparableCircle and GeometricObject classes
        Octagon.java --> extends GeometricObject and implements cloneable and comparable interfaces, includes a main method to test
